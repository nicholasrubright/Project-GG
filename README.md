# Project GG

A dynamic [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) analytics web application. Users can search up their League of Legends summoner name to view their ingame statistics.

The idea was to recreate the basic functionality of the popular League of Legends analytics websites like [op.gg](https://na.op.gg/) or the newer [u.gg](https://u.gg/). This application is nowhere near the capabilities of those applications but I wanted to build this as a proof of concept, that I am able to build basic functionalities using a modern tech stack.

# Technical Overview
